        <h1>Young Entrepreneurs Initiative Club</h1>
            <p>This program is a collaborative effort involving Urban STEM Academy, the Savannah Entrepreneurial Center, and the Career Academy at Hubert Middle school. This program targets 20 middle-school students and is designed to  help motivate and engage middle school students in the practice of technology, and engineering through hands-on learning that aligns with educational pathways for the creation of innovative start-up businesses.

            This initiative capitalizes on the resources of all involved parties to allow positive outcomes for students engaged in the project. The objective of this initiative is to integrate the practical processes of business with the educational goals of science, math, and social studies.

            The goals of the project are to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Encourage creative participation in basic engineering and technology applied studies as a means of stimulating student development and thought patterns.</li>

            <li>Promote an understanding of business economics, and citizenship.</li>

            <li>Create a spirit of entrepreneurship as a means to human progress, individual development, personal achievement, and the ability to create meaningful change for oneself and society.</li>
         </ul>

            	<p>Come August 2016, we are taking our show on the road and coming to a school near you. Each quarter we will offer a 9 week intensive after-school program. During our program, students will be introduced to coding via Google CS First and CodeCademy. Students will also learn about Engineering by creating several projects including building their own robotic arms and electronic prototypes. This program is designed to expose students to coding and engineering through project-based learning experiences. Unlike other programs, THIS IS NOT A WORKSHOP. This is prolonged, intense interaction where students can not only learn the skills, they can also interact with real-world developers and engineers. When the program is complete, we leave behind a CoderDojo where tech-professionals and students can continue to interact and learn from one another. <a href="take_action.html#contact">Contact Us </a>to find out more.</p>
